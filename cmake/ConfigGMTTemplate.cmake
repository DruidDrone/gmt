# ============================================================================
# Basic setup begins here.  All settings are optional.  In most cases, setting
# CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX should be all you need to do in order to build GMT with
# reasonable defaults enabled. Advanced settings are in ConfigUserTemplate.cmake.
# ============================================================================

# 1. Installation path (usually defaults to /usr/local) [automatic]:
#set (CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX "prefix_path")

# 2. Install convenience links for GMT modules. Uncomment to install direct links
# to modules so you can run "modulename options" without leading "gmt" [FALSE]:
#set (GMT_INSTALL_MODULE_LINKS TRUE)

# 3. Set full path to GSHHG Shoreline Database [auto]:
#set (GSHHG_ROOT "gshhg_path")

# 4. Set full path to DCW Digital Chart of the World for GMT [auto]:
#set (DCW_ROOT "dcw-gmt_path")
